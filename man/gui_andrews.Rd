\description{
This GUI allows users to control the andrews tour by simply moving and clicking their mouses.
The Variable Selection checkboxes contains all the numeric variables, and at least three of them need to be checked to make the display work.
All the categorical variables go to the Class Selection box. We should select the class variable by double clicking the variable names.
The Tour Type radio buttons contains four different tour types. They are the Grand Tour, Little Tour, Local Tour and Guided Tour. We can
only choose one type a time. For the Guided Tour, we need to choose an index from the droplist to specify which particular search type is desired.
The default index would be holes. For tour type Guided(lda_pp) and Guided(pda_pp), we also need to specify class variable first, and the Guided(pda_pp)
is also controlled by another parameter, lambda. Lambda ranges from 0 to 1, with default at 0.02. A value of 0 will make the tour operate like Guided(lda_pp).
The Choose Dimension radio buttons allow us to choose the dimension number n to animate a nD tour path with Andrews' curves. Dimension n ranges from 2 to the
total number of the numeric variables of this dataset, and the default dimension is 2. Andrews' curves are static methods for displaying 2 or more variables. Here Andrews' curves are used to
display projections of the full data. See \code{\link{andrews}}
The Speed slider can control the speed of the nD tour. Simply dragging the mouse along the slider, changes the speed from slow to fast.
The Pause check box allow users to pause the dynamic nD tour and have a close examination on the details.
The Apply button allows users to update the nD tour, when it doesn't automatically update.
The Quit button allows users to close thie GUI window.
The Help button provides information about the tour and also what this GUI can do.
Tooltips will pop up when the mouse is moved over the GUI, which give hints about the functionality of the different GUI elements.
