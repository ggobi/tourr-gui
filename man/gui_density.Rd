\title{Density Tour GUI
Displays a Density Tour GUI}
\usage{
gui_density(data = flea, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{matrix, or data frame containing numeric columns, defaults to flea dataset}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link{animate}} and \code{\link{display_xy}}}
}
\description{
This GUI allows users to control the density tour by simply moving and clicking their mouses.
The Variable Selection checkboxes contains all the numeric variables, and at least two of them need to be checked to make the display work.
All the categorical variables go to the Class Selection box. We should select the class variable by double clicking the variable names.
Color isn't implemented with the density tour yet.
The Tour Type radio buttons contains four different tour types. They are the Grand Tour, Little Tour, Local Tour and Guided Tour. We can
only choose one type a time. For the Guided Tour, we need to choose an index from the droplist to specify which particular search type is desired.
The default index would be holes. For tour type Guided(lda_pp) and Guided(pda_pp), we also need to specify class variable first, and the Guided(pda_pp)
is also controlled by another parameter, lambda. Lambda ranges from 0 to 1, with default at 0.02. A value of 0 will make the tour operate like Guided(lda_pp).
For high-dimensional data a value closer to 1 would be advised.
The Method Type radio buttons contains three different display methods. They are histogram, density plot and ash plot.
The distribution of data projected into 1d can be displayed correspondingly as a histogram, kernel density estimate and average shifted histogram.
The Axes Locations column contains two choices, TRUE and FALSE. TRUE means the tour will center at the middle of x-axes,
FALSE means the tour will wander to the left and right. The default value is TRUE.
The Speed slider can control the speed of the 1D tour. Simply dragging the mouse along the slider, changes the speed from slow to fast.
The Pause check box allow users to pause the dynamic 1D tour and have a close examination on the details.
The Apply button allows users to update the 1D tour, when it doesn't automatically update.
The Quit button allows users to close thie GUI window.
The Help button provides information about the tour and also what this GUI can do.
Tooltips will pop up when the mouse is moved over the GUI, which give hints about the functionality of the different GUI elements.
