\details{GUI allows users to control the faces tour tour by simply moving and clicking their mouses.

the categorical variables go to the Class Seclection box. We should select the class variable by double clicking the variable names.

variable.
Tour Type radio buttons contains four different tour types. They are the Grand Tour, Little Tour, Local Tour and Guided Tour. We can 
choose one type a time. For the Guided Tour, we need to choose an index from the droplist to specify which particular search type is desired. 
default index would be holes. For tour type Guided(lda_pp) and Guided(pda_pp), we also need to specify class variable first, and the Guided(pda_pp) 
also controlled by another parameter, lambda. Lambda ranges from 0 to 1, with default at 0.02. A value of 0 will make the tour operate like Guided(lda_pp). 
Choose Dimension radio buttons allow us to choose the dimension number n to animate a nD tour path with Andrews' curves. Dimension n ranges from 2 to the
number of the numeric variables of this dataset. The maximum dimension is 18. 
Choose Face Nuber slider allows users to specify how many faces to display. Face number ranges from 2 to the observation number of this dataset.
