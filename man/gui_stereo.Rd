}
\description{
  This GUI allows users to control the Stereo tour by
  simply moving and clicking their mouses. The Variable
  Selection checkboxes contains all the numeric variables,
  and at least three of them need to be checked to make the
  display work. All the categorical variables go to the
  Class Seclection box. We should select the class variable
  by double clicking the variable names. The Tour Type
  radio buttons contains four different tour types. They
  are the Grand Tour, Little Tour, Local Tour and Guided
  Tour. We can only choose one type a time. For the Guided
  Tour, we need to choose an index from the droplist to
  specify which particular search type is desired. The
  default index would be holes. For tour type
  Guided(lda_pp) and Guided(pda_pp), we also need to
  specify class variable first, and the Guided(pda_pp) is
  also controlled by another parameter, lambda. Lambda
  ranges from 0 to 1, with default at 0.02. A value of 0
  will make the tour operate like Guided(lda_pp). For
  high-dimensional data a value closer to 1 would be
  advised. The Speed slider can control the speed of the 3D
  tour. Simply dragging the mouse along the slider, changes
  the speed from slow to fast. The Pause check box allow
  users to pause the dynamic 3D tour and have a close
  examination on the details. The Apply button allows users
  to update the 3D tour, when it doesn't automatically
  update. The Quit button allows users to close thie GUI
  window. The Help button provides information about the
  tour and also what this GUI can do. Tooltips will pop up
  when the mouse is moved over the GUI, which give hints
  about the functionality of the different GUI elements.
