\description{
This GUI allows users to control the scatterplot tour by simply moving and clicking their mouses.
The Variable Selection checkboxes contains all the numeric variables, and at least three of them need to be checked to make the display work.
All the categorical variables go to the Class Selection box. We should select the class variable by double clicking the variable names. 
If users don't specify the class variable, the selected numeric variables will be considered as one class, and all points will be black.
After users specify the class variable, the points will be considered as different classes according to this 
categorical variable, and these will appear as rainbow colors in the scatterplot tour.
The Tour Type radio buttons contains four different tour types. They are the Grand Tour, Little Tour, Local Tour and Guided Tour. We can 
only choose one type a time. For the Guided Tour, we need to choose an index from the droplist to specify which particular search type is desired. 
The default index is holes. For tour type Guided(lda_pp) and Guided(pda_pp), we also need to specify class variable first. The Guided(pda_pp) 
is also controlled by another parameter, lambda. Lambda ranges from 0 to 1, with default at 0.02. A value of 0 will make the tour operate like Guided(lda_pp). 
For very high-dimensional data a value closer to 1 would be advised.
The Axes Locations column contains three types. Users can specify where tour axes will be displayed. The choices are center, bottomleft and off.
The Speed slider can control the speed of the 2D tour. Simply dragging the mouse along the slider, changes the speed from slow to fast.
The Pause check box allow users to pause the dynamic 2D tour and have a close examination on the details.
The Apply button allows users to update the 2D tour, when it doesn't automatically update.
The Quit button allows users to close thie GUI window.
The Help button provides information about the tour and also what this GUI can do.
Tooltips will pop up when the mouse is moved over the GUI, which give hints about the functionality of the different GUI elements.
