1. displays of animate_andrews, animate_pcp, animate_stereo are flickering.
   So are corresponding gui's.
3. local tour still has some unsolved problems.
4. Color doesn't work for all the other Guis except gui_xy and gui_stereo.
5. Potential problems with animate_image and animate_stereo
    animate_image(ozone,guided_tour(holes)),  animate_image(ozone,guided_tour(cm)), 
    and animate_image(ozone,little_tour()) don't work, only animate_image(ozone,grand_tour(1)) works
    animate_stereo(flea[,1:6],grand_tour(4)) or animate_stereo(flea[,1:6],grand_tour(6)) shouldn't work, 
    and animate_stereo(flea[,1:6],guided_tour(holes)) should work.

0. gui_tour are too long---solved
1. gui_pcp works now
2. displays of animate_andrews, animate_stereo are flickering, so are corresponding gui's.
3. tourer changed to new_tour, 
4. changed tour_animate$step2(aps/33) to tour_animate(aps/33)
5. local tour still has some unsolved problems---currently changed to  
"Local" = local_tour(basis_init(length(var_selected), 2),angle) 
6. gui_stereo, and gui_image work now (changed color specification problem, updated a function)
7, add an angle option for local_tour --- added angle
8. why does density plot have more than 6 variables---grand_tour(1)
9. delete angle option for local tour --- to keep tour_gui clean(easy to manipulate)
