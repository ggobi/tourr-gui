#********************Feb 2010**********************
1. gui_pcp works now
2. displays of animate_andrews, animate_stereo are flickering, so are corresponding gui's.
3. tourer changed to new_tour, 
4. changed tour_animate$step2(aps/33) to tour_animate(aps/33)
5. local tour still has some unsolved problems---currently changed to  
"Local" = local_tour(basis_init(length(var_selected), 2),angle) 
6. gui_stereo, and gui_image work now (changed color specification problem, updated a function)
7, add an angle option for local_tour --- added angle
8. why does density plot have more than 6 variables---grand_tour(1)
9. delete angle option for local tour --- to keep tour_gui clean(easy to manipulate)

#*********************March 2010 - April 2010*********************
10. gui_star doesn't work---stars() argument problem
11. gui_scatmat diagonal display has a problem.---varible name passing problem
